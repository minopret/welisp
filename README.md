This is a straightforward translation of page 10 of the Lisp 1.5
Users Manual into s-expressions in lisp.lsp. Then we make a slightly
less straightforward, but still fairly stark, translation of that
into C99. With the addition of a couple more oddball example/library
files, we all have a Lisp that we can hack on.
